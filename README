RATIONALE

The C++ standard library is known to be less comprehensive than the libraries
available for other programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, etc.). The C++11
standard began to fill this gap by adding several features like support for
multithreading, smart pointers, etc. Incredibly, however, a basic support for
networking is still missing.

During the last years, a number of C++ libraries have been proposed to have
portable networking. The most important libraries are Boost::asio and
cpp-netlib. However, we believe that the syntax of these two libraries is too
complicated. In particular, we believe that an ideal C++ networking library
should be:
 - easy to use
 - easy to extend (eithat in terms of protocols and of supported architectures)

This project is a proof of concept to show that such a networking library can
be made in C++. The syntax of the library is straightforward. The modular
design given by the adoption of design patterns allows to easily add new
protocols and supported platforms.
