INTRODUCTION

LibNet++ is a C++ networking library.

RATIONALE

The C++ standard library is known to be less comprehensive than the libraries
usually available for other programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, etc.).
The C++11 standard began to fill this gap by adding several features like
support for multithreading, smart pointers, etc. Incredibly, however, a basic
support for networking is still missing.

During the last years, a number of C++ libraries have been proposed to have
portable networking, the most important being Boost::asio
(http://www.boost.org/libs/asio/) and cpp-netlib (http://cpp-netlib.org).
However, we believe that the syntax of both libraries is more complicated than
necessary.
In particular, we believe that an ideal C++ networking library should be:
 - easy to use
 - easy to extend (either in terms of protocols and of supported architectures)

LibNet++ is a proof of concept to show that such a networking library can be
made in C++. The syntax of the library is straightforward. The modular design
given by the adoption of design patterns allows to easily add new protocols and
supported platforms.

REQUIREMENTS

To build LibNet++ you need both cmake (http://www.cmake.org) and a C++11
compiler (e.g., gcc 4.7+ or LLVM 3.3+).

Currently, the library supports only Posix systems (e.g., Linux). However,
porting the library to different platforms is easy thanks to its modular
design.

HOW TO BUILD

Compile through the following commands:

	cd libnetpp/build
	cmake ..
	make
	make install

The library is put in the libnetpp/bin/ directory.
